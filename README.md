## **Introduction**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain data and methods. This repository focuses on providing a comprehensive understanding of OOP through the lens of Java programming.

### Why Learn OOP?
- Organizes code for better reusability and scalability.
- Models real-world entities using classes and objects.
- Promotes modular design and code maintainability.

## **Key OOP Principles**

1. **Encapsulation**
   - Wrapping data (fields) and code (methods) into a single unit (class).
   - Example: Private variables with public getters and setters.

2. **Abstraction**
   - Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features.
   - Example: Abstract classes and interfaces.

3. **Inheritance**
   - Allowing one class to inherit fields and methods from another class.
   - Example: `class Dog extends Animal {}`

4. **Polymorphism**
   - Allowing methods to perform different behaviors based on the object.
   - Example: Method Overloading and Method Overriding.
